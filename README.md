# HIV-Prevalence-by-Region-in-118-Countries.
This project analyzed the relationship between regionsâ€™ income and HIV prevalence using data on world GDP, world HIV, and world population. The data was collected from three different sources using Python web scraping. The analysis aimed to determine if income affects HIV prevalence in different regions of the world.
I have been working on a data project where I collected data from three different sources using Python Web scraping. I then used Python and Excel to clean the data. Finally, I used Visual Studio as an ETL tool to extract, transfer, and load the data into the staging area on SQL Server Management Studio.
